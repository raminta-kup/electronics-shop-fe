## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Component-Based Development
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)
- Mobile-first approach

### What I learned

#### React

- I deepened my understanding of React's component-based architecture. I learned how to create and manage reusable components, making my code more modular and maintainable.
- I became proficient in using React's state management to handle dynamic data within my application. This allowed me to create interactive and responsive user interfaces.
- I explored the Context API to efficiently manage global state, simplifying data sharing between components and reducing the need for prop drilling.

#### MongoDB

I delved into using MongoDB to fetch and manage data for my application. This included configuring and initializing a connection to the MongoDB database server, defining a data schema to specify the structure of documents, creating a data model to interact with the database, implementing API routes for data retrieval, and effectively handling responses, including error handling. This knowledge significantly enhanced my ability to work with databases and retrieve data efficiently.
